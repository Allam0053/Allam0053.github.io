**Game Developer**

Dec 2021

- Developed a tank driving game using Three.js as a final project for a computer graphics class.
- Implemented quaternions to represent rotations in 3D space and provide smooth and accurate movement of the tank.
- Used object mesh to create 3D models of the tank and T-Rex enemies and implemented lights and shadows to create a realistic environment.
- Created an immersive gameplay experience where the player must navigate through an environment filled with obstacles and enemies, hitting T-Rex enemies by driving through them without crashing.
- Demonstrated knowledge of quaternions, object mesh in Three.js, lights in WebGL and Three.js, and shadows in WebGL and Three.js to create a practical game development application.
