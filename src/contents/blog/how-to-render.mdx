# How to Rerender State, Context, Reducer

Basically re-render triggered everytime the value of the state is changed.

if the state is an object, it has to update the reference to trigger a re-render.

if the state is an primitive data type, it will update everytime the value change.

```tsx
function ObjectStateComponent() {
  const [objectState, setObjectState] = useState({data: 0, owner: 'allam'});

  useEffect(() => {
    setObjectState({
      ...objectState,
      data: 1
    });
  }, []);

  return <>{objectState.data}<>
}
```

NOTE: âœ… this is the proper way to update the value and trigger a rerender. since the object is updated by declaring a new Object.

this is a very common use case. But, how if our state has a complex property or we passed it throught a `ContextProvider` ??
