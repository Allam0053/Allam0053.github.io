## Hydration Error (is actually not an error)

This error accure when server-rendered HTML does not match with the client result.
in my case, it appears when I use `next-theme`. It appear in hooks that `next-theme` used (in `[theme, setTheme]`).
when client start the lifecycle to `componentDidMount` or `React.useEffect(fn, [])` the client rendered the `theme` and that's cause the Hydration Error.

for example:

- code:

  ```jsx
     import { useTheme } from 'next-theme';

     export function helloWorld() {
        const [theme, setTheme] = useTheme();

        return (
           <>{theme}<>
        );
     }
  ```

  the server-rendered will send an empty div, `theme` is not rendered from the server, so it's just `<><>` instead of `<>{theme}<>`

- when the code is received to client, the `theme` got rendered. so this is where I am right NOW.

  - server source:
    ```html
    <><>
    ```
  - NOW:
    ```html
    <>dark<>
    ```
    note: my chrome default `color-scheme` is dark

- as can be seen that there is difference between server source and NOW. that cause the Hydration Error.
- insisting a value is a way to get rid of Hydration Error. `{theme ? theme : 'dark'}`.
