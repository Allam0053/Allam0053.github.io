### SIBANTANK

**Game Developer**

Dec 2021

Si BanTank is a Tank Driving Game and it was an exciting class final project built using Three.js. As the name suggests, this game is all about driving a tank and hitting enemies, but instead of shooting them, the player has to drive through them. The enemies in this game are T-Rexes that have wings, which adds a unique and challenging element to the gameplay.

The objective of the project is to implement the concepts taught in class, including quaternions, object mesh in Three.js, lights in WebGL and Three.js, and shadows in WebGL and Three.js. Through this project, the developer gains a deeper understanding of these concepts by applying them to a practical application.

The game is built using Three.js, a JavaScript library that allows for the creation and rendering of 3D graphics on the web. The player controls the tank and must navigate through an environment filled with obstacles and enemies. The goal is to hit as many enemies as possible by driving through them without crashing into the obstacles.

The use of quaternions is an essential part of the game's mechanics. Quaternions are a way of representing rotations in three-dimensional space, which is crucial for the tank's movements in the game. The object mesh in Three.js is used to create the 3D models of the tank and the T-Rex enemies, while lights and shadows are used to create a realistic and immersive environment.

Overall, Tank Driving Game is a fun and challenging project that allows developers to apply their knowledge of quaternions, object mesh, lights, and shadows to a practical game development application. With its unique gameplay and use of Three.js, this game is sure to be a hit with both game enthusiasts and developers alike.
