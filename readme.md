As one of the college assignment, me and my group created a simple survey web app using laravel. The main feature is the survey page and admin authentication. It has few routing, so it is not a complicated app. After created a monolithic app, we refactor it using some architecture. My part is to refactor dashboard use case to be a Factory Pattern.
